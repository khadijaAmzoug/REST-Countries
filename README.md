## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS3 (Flexbox + Grid)
- JavaScript (DOM, fetch API)
- REST Countries API
- Mobile-first approach
- Light/Dark mode switch

### What I learned

While building this project, I learned how to:

- Fetch and display data from an external API
- Dynamically update the DOM based on user input
- Use event delegation and manage navigation between pages
- Implement a dark/light theme using JavaScript

```js
// Example of dynamic fetch
fetch('https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all')
  .then(res => res.json())
  .then(data => displayCountries(data));

## Continued development
In the future, I want to:

Improve accessibility (keyboard navigation, ARIA)

Add loading animations and error messages

Optimize for performance and SEO
