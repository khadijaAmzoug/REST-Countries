## Reflection

Working on this project helped me improve both my technical and problem-solving skills. One of the main goals was to build a responsive and accessible web app that fetches data from an external API and displays it dynamically. I learned how to work with the Fetch API, handle asynchronous data, and manipulate the DOM efficiently.

At the beginning, I faced some challenges with understanding how the data from the REST Countries API was structured. Some countries had missing or differently structured data (like missing capitals or multiple native names), so I had to add conditional checks to avoid breaking the app. This helped me improve my debugging skills and write more resilient JavaScript code.

Another feature I enjoyed implementing was the dark mode toggle. It taught me how to use `localStorage` to remember the user's theme preference across sessions. I also practiced using `addEventListener`, working with form inputs (like search and filter), and improving accessibility by keeping the layout clean and navigable.

Finally, deploying the project on Netlify taught me how to troubleshoot deployment issues that may not appear in local development—such as CORS problems or file path errors.

Overall, I’m proud of the final result, and I feel more confident in building dynamic web interfaces using vanilla JavaScript.
